  SAVE MY TOYS
----------------
The maniacal Dr. Frankenstein has stolen all the world's toys and given them LIFE to use as slaves in his castle!
Luckily the toys managed to escape from the Dr's clutches. Now they find themselves lost and far from home.
Can you help them find their way?
Good luck!

Stuck on a level? Between you and me, pressing the N key (for 'N'ext) will skip ahead. Hush, it's a secret!
