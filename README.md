## Plot
> The maniacal Dr. Frankenstein has stolen all the world's toys and given them LIFE to use as slaves in his castle!
> Luckily the toys managed to escape from the Dr's clutches.  
> Now they find themselves lost and far from home.
> Can you help them find their way?  
> Good luck!


## Controls
Use the MOUSE cursor to drop tiles in the world to control the flow of toys.

Click the GHOSTLY KILL BUTTON to expunge any remaining toys. Don't worry, if you have rescued enough toys then you will still win the level :-)

To quit gameplay and return to main menu - Press ESCAPE  
To quit app from main menu - Press ESCAPE

Stuck on a level? Between you and me, pressing the N key (for 'N'ext) will skip ahead. Hush, it's a secret!
